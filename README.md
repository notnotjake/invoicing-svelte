# LightDance Billing System

Boutique invoicing solution.

Start with just having individual transaction pages, and add a full portal later on. Communicate via automated emails. Have hosted pages for each of these transactions (estimates, invoices, payments, etc.)

Notes to Self:
- Create projects, estimates, invoices, then payments.
- Invoices need an email, printable PDF, and hosted page with Stripe link
- Recurring invoices/payments. Get very explicit permission to charge recurring
Payments:
- Support partial payments
- Payment confirmations emails
- Payment history in customer portal

Transactions (MVP):
- Estimates
- Invoices
- Payments

Future 'transactions': ~setup wizard, contracts, deliverables, project status, site status (technical), service incident, feedback/exit-survey,
